            Scientists recognize 40 or more species of extinct penguins.

Scientists believe that penguins diverged from flying birds at least 60 to 65 million years ago during the Cretaceous Period. As the ancestors of penguins became adapted to an oceanic environment, structural changes for diving and swimming led to the loss of flying adaptations.

To date, the discovery of all penguin fossil fragments has been limited to the Southern Hemisphere. Records show that prehistoric penguins were found within the range of present-day penguins.

The earliest penguin fossil fragments were found in New Zealand in the mid-1800s. The oldest penguin fossils date from 61 to 62 million years ago.
Fossil records show that the largest extinct species lived in the Miocene Period (11 to 25 million years ago). Pachydyptes ponderosus probably stood 1.4 to 1.5 m (4.5 to 5 ft.) and may have weighed 90 to 135 kg (198 to 298 lbs.) Anthropornis nordenskjoldi probably stood 1.5 to 1.8 m (5 to 5.9 ft.) and weighed 90 to 135 kg (198 to 298 lbs.) Measurements are estimates, since only a few bone fragments have been found.
